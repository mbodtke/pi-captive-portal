# pi-captive-portal

Project Overview:  Use Raspberry Pi Zero as a roaming, battery powered access point.  The access point should redirect to a captive portal, that provides information about the project, a visitor log book, and some sort of entertainment.  Motivation comes from long waits at airport gates, where you are stationary and surrounded by many people on their phones/laptops.

Initial Goals:
1) Set up Pi Zero to use external an wireless adapter.
2) Get access point up and running

Intermediate Goals:
1) Set up basic project information page.
2) Enable captive portal functionality to redirect all visitors to page

Stretch Goals:
1) Deploy project into the world
2) Investigate larger antenna for better wireless coverage
3) Provide additional functionality such as a visitor log book, message sharing, or some sort of media entertainment.
